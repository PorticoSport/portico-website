This boom has been partly driven by contributions from Padel court manufacturers like Portico Sport, a global leader in the sector, playing a crucial role in the sport's expansion. Portico Sport has already completed notable projects such as Virgin Active Padel Club The Glen and Atlantic Padel Table View in Cape Town. </p><p>The most sought-after courts in South Africa include the Club, Panoramic, and, notably, the patented Club Force 80 and Panoramic Force 80 by Portico Sport, unique in the market. The Force 80 Padel courts feature a superior brace design and a special anchoring system, capable of withstanding hurricane-force winds, making them ideal for areas with extreme weather conditions. Their innovative construction has positioned these Padel courts as the most durable on the market, reinforcing Padel's growth in South Africa and securing its expansion across the country.</p><p>We hope that Padel will continue its expansion in other cities such as Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, Nelspruit or Kimberley.</p>"
